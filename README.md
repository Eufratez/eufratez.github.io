## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Eufratez/eufratez.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
	<h1> My first HTML file <3</h1><br>
	<p>Welcome to my family site </p><br>
	<p>For any other questions about this web page please go <a href="https://github.com/Eufratez">here</a></p>
	<p> <img src="https://c.tenor.com/1GFGoqTI4F0AAAAC/welcome-to-the-team-minions.gif=true"></p><br>
	</body>
	
</html>
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Eufratez/eufratez.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
